# Lab Name
z-mix

# Short Description
z-mix will offer a generic way to create Zero-Knowledge proofs, proving statements about multiple cryptographic building blocks, containing signatures, commitments, and verifiable encryption.

# Scope of Lab
The goal of z-mix is to become a part of Hyperledger crypto-lib, and eventually be adopted by Hyperledger projects. Multiple existing Hyperledger projects require Zero-Knowledge proofs, e.g., Fabric and Indy. The goal of this library is to provide a single flexible and secure implementation to construct such proofs.
