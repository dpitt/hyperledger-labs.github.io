# Lab Name

Patient Consent

# Short Description

Use Case Patient Data in Clinical Trials Automation with focus of Patient Consent

# Scope of Lab

We want to develop the integration of stakeholders in one platform, starting incrementally 
with small fragments of the eco system; e.g. Clinical Studies; electronic informed consent 
on a small enterprise blockchain/closed ledger system, healthcare chain ensuring secure 
flows of sensitive data on the cloud with rules and governance on the Hyperledger Frameworks. 
We aim to provide value to two main stakeholder groups: Pharma companies/Medtech with CROs and Patients. 

Use case realizations with two frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth

# Pre-existing repository

There are no appropriate repos for now. 

Same solution will have two versions based on Fabric and Sawtooth accordingly. 
For this needs two separate repos required like:

https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-patient-consent

https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/sawtooth-patient-consent
