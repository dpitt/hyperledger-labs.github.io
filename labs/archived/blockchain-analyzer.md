# Lab Name
Blockchain Analyzer

# Short Description
The aim of this lab is to create a tool for visualizing and analyzing Hyperledger Fabric ledger from both operational and data-oriented aspects. It provides dashboards similar to Hyperledger Explorer, but it is applicable for data queries (e.g. medicine provenance, supply chain) as well.

The user can inspect the data of multiple peers and multiple channels at the same time.

A further goal of this project is to be suitable for any blockchain solution.
