# Lab Name
Hyperledger Fabric Consortium Management

# Short Description
Chaincode based application to manage Fabric Consortium memberships

# Scope of Lab
Venders of Hyperledger Fabric network services can each offer their services to the customers,
when customers use different vendors, they often have problems to join an existing fabric
network due to lacking formally defined process and format of information exchanges. This
project started by Hyperleder Fabric Interop Working Group(https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Fabric+Interop+Working+Group)
has formally defined the organization join process based on the application chaincode and
user interface so that each organization admins can easily locate new org join request,
approve or disapprove the request and eventually allow a new organization quickly
become part of a running fabric network.
